# Benchmarks

The `voids.benchmarks` sub-package provides utilities for cross-checking `voids`
results against reference implementations such as OpenPNM and XLB. In the
broader project documentation, these utilities belong to the **verification**
side of the Verification & Validation split: they benchmark `voids` against
software references or alternative numerical workflows, not directly against
experimental measurements.

The two high-level segmented-volume benchmark wrappers now share the same
physical pressure convention:

- the preferred public input is the physical pressure drop `delta_p`, typically
  in Pa
- optional `pin` and `pout` values can also be supplied when the user wants to
  preserve a particular absolute pressure reference level
- for the current incompressible permeability benchmark, only the pressure drop
  `Δp = pin - pout` affects the reported permeability
- the applied `p_inlet_physical`, `p_outlet_physical`, and `dp_physical` values
  are recorded in the benchmark result tables

So `delta_p=1.0`, `pin=1.0`/`pout=0.0`, and `delta_p=1.0` with
`pin=101326.0`/`pout=101325.0` all represent the same current benchmark
driving condition.

The XLB benchmark API now has two distinct package layers:

- `voids.lbm.singlephase.xlb.solve_binary_volume_with_xlb` is the low-level
  direct-image solver. It works in lattice units and accepts lattice pressure
  boundary conditions through `pressure_inlet_lattice`,
  `pressure_outlet_lattice`, or `pressure_drop_lattice`.
- `voids.benchmarks.xlb.benchmark_segmented_volume_with_xlb` is the high-level
  verification wrapper. It resolves a physical pressure drop from `delta_p` and
  optional `pin` / `pout`, then maps that same physical `Δp` into lattice units
  before calling XLB on the original binary image.

For backward compatibility, `voids.benchmarks.xlb` re-exports the low-level XLB
types and direct solver, but the implementation lives in `voids.lbm`.

For the high-level XLB benchmark, `fluid.density` must be provided because the
shared physical pressure drop must be converted into lattice pressure units.
