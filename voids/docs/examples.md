# Examples and Notebooks

The `notebooks/` directory contains paired Jupyter notebooks and `py:percent` scripts
covering the main `voids` workflows, from the smallest synthetic pore-network
example to image-based sensitivity studies, map-based upscaling, direct-image LBM,
and OpenPNM benchmarks.

Each notebook is both a tutorial and a regression artifact: if it no longer runs,
some documented scientific workflow has drifted.

---

## Running the Notebooks

With Pixi:

```bash
pixi run register-kernels   # register Jupyter kernels once
jupyter lab                  # open JupyterLab
```

The notebooks rely on environment variables set by Pixi activation
(`VOIDS_PROJECT_ROOT`, `VOIDS_DATA_PATH`, etc.), so they should be launched from
within a Pixi-managed shell.

In practice:

- use `default` for most notebooks, including OpenPNM, thermodynamic-viscosity,
  FVM/FEM map-based, and XLB/LBM workflows
- use `test` when you want the full test-suite dependency set around the notebook workflow
- expect the image-based notebooks to be materially heavier than the minimal demos

## Notebook Overview

### 01 — Minimal Single-Phase Solve

**`01_mwe_singlephase_porosity_perm`**

Demonstrates the canonical single-phase workflow on a small synthetic network:

- build a `Network` from scratch
- compute absolute porosity
- solve incompressible single-phase flow
- extract directional permeability

This is the best starting point for understanding the core API.

---

### 02 — OpenPNM Cross-Check

**`02_mwe_openpnm_crosscheck_optional`**

Imports a PoreSpy/OpenPNM-style dictionary into `voids`, solves the same flow problem
with both `voids` and OpenPNM, and compares permeability estimates.
Requires the `test` Pixi environment (OpenPNM dependency).

---

### 03 — PyVista Visualization

**`03_mwe_pyvista_visualization`**

Shows optional 3-D network rendering using PyVista:

- pore coloring by pressure field
- throat sizing by conductance
- export to interactive HTML

---

### 04 — Manufactured PoreSpy Extraction

**`04_mwe_manufactured_porespy_extraction`**

Creates a deterministic 3D void image, extracts a pore network with PoreSpy, imports
it into `voids`, and serializes the result to HDF5.

---

### 05 — Cartesian Mesh Network

**`05_mwe_cartesian_mesh_network`**

Generates a configurable 2D or 3D mesh-like pore network, solves single-phase flow,
creates a Plotly interactive visualization, and exports to HDF5.

---

### 06 — Real PoreSpy Extraction (Ketton)

**`06_mwe_real_porespy_extraction`**

Applies the full extraction → import → solve → diagnostics pipeline to a real
segmented Ketton carbonate image.

---

### 07 — Synthetic Vug Case

**`07_mwe_synthetic_vug_case`**

Processes a grayscale synthetic vug volume, extracts the network, solves flow, and
compares results with and without pruning isolated void clusters.

---

### 08 — Image-Based Vug Shape Sensitivity (3D)

**`08_mwe_image_based_vug_shape_sensitivity`**

Controlled sensitivity study comparing a baseline network against networks with
spherical or ellipsoidal vugs. Reports porosity, absolute permeability `Kabs`, and
network statistics.

---

### 09 — Image-Based Vug Sensitivity (2D)

**`09_mwe_image_based_vug_sensitivity_2d`**

Simplified 2D counterpart of notebook 08 using circular and elliptical inclusions.
Produces porosity vs. `Kabs` and `K/K0` distributions.

---

### 10 — Lattice-Based Vug Sensitivity (3D)

**`10_mwe_lattice_based_vug_sensitivity`**

Stochastic lattice-based baselines with spherical and ellipsoidal vug insertions.
Reports `Kabs`/porosity sensitivity curves and `K/K0` distributions across multiple
realisations.

---

### 11 — Lattice-Based Vug Sensitivity (2D)

**`11_mwe_lattice_based_vug_sensitivity_2d`**

Simplified 2D lattice counterpart with circular and elliptical vugs, multi-baseline
sensitivity study, and `K/K0` frequency distributions.

---

### 12 — Synthetic Volume OpenPNM Benchmark

**`12_mwe_synthetic_volume_openpnm_benchmark`**

Builds synthetic spanning volumes, derives a synthetic grayscale segmentation,
extracts a network with PoreSpy, and compares resulting `Kabs` predictions between
`voids` and OpenPNM.

This notebook is the closest thing in the current tree to an end-to-end extraction
and solver-comparison benchmark.
The corresponding narrative report is documented in
[Verification & Validation / Verification / OpenPNM Extracted-Network Cross-Check](verification/openpnm.md).

---

### 13 — Synthetic Volume XLB Benchmark

**`13_mwe_synthetic_volume_xlb_benchmark`**

Builds fifteen synthetic segmented spanning volumes, solves them directly with XLB
on the binary image, extracts pore networks with `snow2`, and compares resulting
`Kabs` predictions between XLB and `voids`.

This is the notebook to use when the scientific question is whether the extracted
PNM workflow tracks a higher-fidelity voxel-scale reference closely enough.
It also documents the actual LBM formulation used by the current XLB adapter and
includes the shared pressure-drop mapping used to couple PNM and XLB, explains
why the preferred high-level input is `delta_p` rather than an absolute
pressure level, and includes a full 15-case steady Stokes-limit rerun alongside the standard
benchmark-mode comparison.
The corresponding narrative report is documented in
[Verification & Validation / Verification / XLB Direct-Image Permeability Benchmark](verification/xlb.md).

---

### 15 — External Reference CNM Benchmark

**`15_mwe_external_pnflow_benchmark`**

Loads a committed external reference dataset, reruns the current `voids`
workflow on the same exact saved binary volumes, and compares permeability,
porosity, and extracted-network size.

The notebook now separates two questions explicitly:

- imported-CNM parity, using the saved external network with
  a benchmark-specific compatibility switch enabled
- full workflow mismatch, using `snow2` on the original saved binary image

This is the notebook to use when the scientific question is whether the current
`voids` image-to-network workflow tracks an independent external PNM workflow
closely enough on controlled synthetic cases.
The corresponding narrative report is documented in
[Verification & Validation / Verification / External Reference CNM Benchmark](verification/pnflow.md).

---

### 16 — `Kabs` Benchmark: Constant vs Thermodynamic Viscosity

**`16_mwe_viscosity_model_kabs_benchmark`**

Benchmarks the apparent permeability estimate obtained with:

- a constant viscosity equal to the midpoint viscosity over the pressure interval
- a pressure-dependent thermodynamic viscosity field tabulated from `thermo`

This notebook is the right entry point when the scientific question is whether
pressure-dependent viscosity materially changes `Kabs` for a fixed network geometry.

---

### 17 — Solver Options Benchmark

**`17_mwe_solver_options_benchmark`**

Benchmarks the currently available solver options on constant-viscosity,
pressure-dependent-viscosity, and FEM map-solver cases. It is the right notebook
when the question is numerical rather than physical: which combination of SciPy
direct solve, explicit UMFPACK, Krylov method, nonlinear strategy, `pyamg`
preconditioner, or FEM linear backend is most effective for a given regime.

For setup guidance and stable benchmark plots, see
[Solver Backends And Performance](fem_solver_backends.md).

---

### 18 — DRP-317 Berea Validation

**`18_mwe_drp317_berea_raw_porosity_perm`**

Runs the current image-to-network workflow on the DRP-317 Berea sandstone volume and
compares porosity and apparent permeability against the experimental values reported
for the same rock sample. The notebook now evaluates `PoreSpy snow2`, PREGO, and
native maximal-ball extraction on the same selected ROI.

The corresponding narrative report is documented in
[Verification & Validation / Validation / DRP-317 Berea Notebook Report](validation/drp317_berea.md).

---

### 19 — DRP-317 Bentheimer Validation

**`19_mwe_drp317_bentheimer_raw_porosity_perm`**

Runs the same validation workflow for the Bentheimer sandstone case from DRP-317,
including ROI diagnostics, extracted-network porosity, directional permeability,
extraction-backend sensitivity, and a same-network conductance-model audit for
the current PoreSpy/PREGO transport options.

The corresponding narrative report is documented in
[Verification & Validation / Validation / DRP-317 Bentheimer Notebook Report](validation/drp317_bentheimer.md).

---

### 20 — DRP-317 Bandera Gray Validation

**`20_mwe_drp317_banderagray_raw_porosity_perm`**

Runs the DRP-317 Bandera Gray validation case. This low-permeability case remains
one of the clearest tests of how strongly the pore-network permeability depends
on the extraction backend.

The corresponding narrative report is documented in
[Verification & Validation / Validation / DRP-317 Bandera Gray Notebook Report](validation/drp317_banderagray.md).

---

### 21-28 - Additional DRP-317 Sandstones

**`21_mwe_drp317_banderabrown_raw_porosity_perm`**
**`22_mwe_drp317_bereasistergray_raw_porosity_perm`**
**`23_mwe_drp317_bereauppergray_raw_porosity_perm`**
**`24_mwe_drp317_buffberea_raw_porosity_perm`**
**`25_mwe_drp317_castlegate_raw_porosity_perm`**
**`26_mwe_drp317_kirby_raw_porosity_perm`**
**`27_mwe_drp317_leopard_raw_porosity_perm`**
**`28_mwe_drp317_parker_raw_porosity_perm`**

These notebooks extend the DRP-317 workflow to the remaining raw binary volumes
under `examples/data/drp-317/`. They keep the same current PNM setup as notebooks
18-20: ROI-based extraction from the full `1000^3` volume, pressure-dependent
water viscosity, and directional `Kabs` comparison against the Table 1
experimental values from the Scientific Reports paper. Each notebook now runs
`PoreSpy snow2`, PREGO, and native maximal-ball extraction so the validation
report can separate experimental mismatch from backend sensitivity.

The published-reference values used by all eleven DRP-317 notebooks are committed in
`examples/data/drp-317/drp317_experimental_references.csv`.

---

### 29-30 - DRP-443 Fractured IFN Cases

**`29_mwe_drp443_ifn_raw_porosity_perm`**
**`30_mwe_drp443_dilatedifn_raw_porosity_perm`**

These notebooks benchmark `voids` on two DRP-443 induced-fracture-network
volumes (`IFN` and `DilatedIFN`) using published-reference values from SPE
212849 Table 2.

For DRP-443, both workflows are intentionally full-volume only (no ROI
selection/subvolume analysis), matching your fractured-media requirement.

The extracted published-reference values used by these notebooks are committed in
`examples/data/drp-443/drp443_reference_values.csv`.

The corresponding report is documented in
[Verification & Validation / Verification / DRP-443 Fracture-Network Verification Overview](verification/drp443.md).

---

### 31 - DRP-10 Estaillades v2

**`31_mwe_drp10_estaillades_raw_porosity_perm`**

This notebook benchmarks `voids` on the DRP-10 Estaillades v2 carbonate volume
using porosity and permeability references from Muljadi et al. (2016). It uses
the native maximal-ball extractor as the primary workflow, then compares it
against PoreSpy `snow2` default settings and a compatibility-repaired `snow2`
configuration. The notebook solves `Kx`, `Ky`, and `Kz` for each backend and
exports directional and mean-`Kabs` CSV summaries.

The corresponding report is documented in
[Verification & Validation / Verification / DRP-10 Estaillades Verification Overview](verification/drp10.md).

---

### 32 - PREGO Synthetic Blob Backend Comparison

**`32_mwe_prego_blobs_backend_comparison`**

This notebook compares extraction backends on synthetic PoreSpy `blobs` volumes
at notebook scale. It generates three spanning `256^3` binary blob images,
extracts networks from the same images with PoreSpy `snow2`, `prego`, and
`native_maximal_ball`, and compares:

- pore and throat counts,
- absolute and effective porosity,
- coordination number,
- pore and throat diameter distributions,
- extraction wall time,
- and single-phase `Kx` under the same `voids` pressure-boundary solve.

The PREGO branch uses the algorithmic spherical seed search and level-queue
region-growth mode. The faster cubic seed search and stamped-sphere growth path
remain available as explicit opt-in settings for runtime-focused comparisons.

The corresponding rendered notebook report is documented in
[Examples / Notebook Reports / PREGO Synthetic Blob Backend Comparison](notebook_reports/32_mwe_prego_blobs_backend_comparison.md).

---

### 33 - Synthetic Porosity Maps

**`33_mwe_synthetic_porosity_maps`**

This notebook demonstrates the continuum-field porosity-map workflow on a
synthetic `300^3` PoreSpy `blobs` volume. It computes:

- a binary-image porosity map by block-averaging segmented void fraction,
- a grayscale-image porosity map using two-point calibration and background
  porosity,
- associated Kozeny-Carman permeability maps,
- HDF5 exports for downstream solver-specific conversion,
- and a comparison figure for the input slices and local porosity fields.

The grayscale image is a toy partial-volume field derived from the same binary
image, so the notebook validates workflow mechanics rather than scanner
calibration for a real micro-CT dataset.
The full calculation and verification logic is documented in
[Concepts and Background / Porosity Maps](porosity_maps.md).

---

## DRP-317 Data Source

## Rendered Notebook Reports

The notebooks below are also rendered directly into the docs from their committed
`.ipynb` outputs, without re-executing them during the docs build:

The DRP-317 experimental-comparison notebooks are documented separately under

are written as experimental-validation reports rather than as frozen rendered
notebook outputs.
