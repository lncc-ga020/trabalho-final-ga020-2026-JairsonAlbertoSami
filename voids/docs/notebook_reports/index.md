# Notebook Reports

This section renders selected notebooks directly into the documentation from their
committed `.ipynb` files. The docs build does **not** execute them again; it uses the
outputs already stored in the notebooks.

In the site navigation, these pages live under [Examples](../examples.md).

That design is intentional:

- the rendered page is a frozen research artifact tied to a committed notebook state
- the docs build remains fast and deterministic
- heavy notebooks do not need to be re-executed just to rebuild the site

The current rendered set focuses on the benchmark and comparison notebooks whose
stored outputs are already publication-style:

- [14 — Shape-Factor Conductance Comparison](14_mwe_shape_factor_conductance_comparison.md)
- [15 — External Reference CNM Benchmark](15_mwe_external_pnflow_benchmark.md)
- [16 — `Kabs` Benchmark: Constant vs Thermodynamic Viscosity](16_mwe_viscosity_model_kabs_benchmark.md)
- [17 — Solver Options Benchmark](17_mwe_solver_options_benchmark.md)
- [32 — PREGO Synthetic Blob Backend Comparison](32_mwe_prego_blobs_backend_comparison.md)

The complete notebook inventory, including paired `.py` scripts, remains documented in
[Examples](../examples.md).

The DRP-317 sandstone studies are documented separately under
[Verification & Validation / Validation](../validation/index.md), because those
pages are written as experimental-validation reports rather than as frozen
rendered notebook pages.
