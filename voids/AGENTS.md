# AGENTS.md

Instructions for Codex and other agentic assistants working in this repository.

## Scope

This file applies to the whole repository tree unless a deeper `AGENTS.md`
overrides part of it.

## Project Context

- `voids` is a scientific Python package for pore network modeling (PNM).
- The current scientific emphasis is:
  - canonical network representation,
  - reproducible geometry and provenance handling,
  - validated single-phase transport,
  - image-to-network workflows that make assumptions explicit.
- The repository is a package-first codebase, not a loose script collection.
  Prefer library-quality changes over notebook-local reinvention.
- Multiphase flow is not implemented yet. Do not describe it as available.

## Runtime Portability

- These instructions are intended to work across different PCs and different LLM
  runtimes.
- Do not assume a specific assistant client, shell profile, editor integration,
  or local absolute path.
- If nested `AGENTS.md` handling is unavailable in a given runtime, follow the
  most specific instructions that are visible and say so when it matters.
- Prefer commands that work from the repository root.

## Scientific Rigor (Required)

- Be rigorous in mathematical, physical, and numerical reasoning.
- Double-check dimensional consistency, sign conventions, and geometry/units
  assumptions before finalizing changes.
- Prefer conservative claims:
  - separate what was executed from what was inferred from code inspection,
  - identify assumptions that remain unverified,
  - say how those assumptions could fail and how to test them.
- For extraction, permeability, porosity, and transport claims, treat provenance,
  sample geometry, and boundary conditions as part of the scientific model.

## Public Surface And Copyright Safety

- Do not copy code from non-distributed software, local ignored directories, or
  unpublished external implementations.
- Do not imply that non-distributed external software ships with `voids`.
- Public docs, comments, and examples should describe external comparisons in a
  generic and accurate way unless the user explicitly wants a benchmark page
  that names a specific public reference.
- Prefer reimplementation from:
  - published papers,
  - public documentation,
  - independently observed behavior,
  - the scientific requirements of `voids`.
- Avoid large verbatim quotations from papers or external documentation.

## Repository Boundaries

- Treat ignored and local-only areas as non-public implementation aids unless
  the user explicitly asks to work with them:
  - `refs/`
  - `tmp/`
  - `outputs/`
  - `.pixi/`
  - `site/`
- Do not make tracked source or docs depend on files from ignored directories.
- Do not present local-only artifacts as part of the repository contract.

## Environment Discovery

- Preferred environment manager: Pixi.
- Secondary path: editable `pip install -e .` with optional extras.
- On a fresh machine, first determine what is available before attempting heavy
  runs.
- Preferred discovery order:
  1. inspect `README.md`, `pixi.toml`, and `pyproject.toml`,
  2. check whether `pixi` is available,
  3. if needed, check whether Python can import `voids` and the relevant
     optional stack.
- Do not commit machine-specific activation commands or absolute environment
  paths.

## Canonical Commands

Use the repository tasks before inventing ad hoc alternatives:

- `pixi run examples-singlephase`
- `pixi run test`
- `pixi run test-cov`
- `pixi run test-lbm`
- `pixi run lint`
- `pixi run format-check`
- `pixi run typecheck`
- `pixi run spec-check`
- `pixi run crosscheck-roundtrip`
- `pixi run notebooks-smoke`
- `pixi run docs-build`
- `pixi run docs-serve`
- `pixi run precommit`
- `pixi run precommit-sync`

If only a lightweight check is needed, prefer the narrowest meaningful command
over the full suite.

## Testing, Coverage, And Typing Requirements

- Any change to shipped `voids` behavior should be accompanied by tests or test
  updates that cover the changed behavior.
- Treat test coverage as a hard quality gate for code changes:
  - aim for at least `99%` coverage for the affected `voids` code path,
  - do not accept untested new logic unless the user explicitly accepts the
    verification gap,
  - use `pixi run test-cov` as the authoritative repository coverage check.
- Treat typing as a hard quality gate for added or modified code:
  - do not leave new or changed code with MyPy issues,
  - use `pixi run typecheck` as the authoritative typing check.
- Prefer also running the style checks that match the repository tasks:
  - `pixi run lint`
  - `pixi run format-check`
  - `pixi run precommit`
- When the change touches optional XLB/LBM functionality, prefer the dedicated
  narrow task before escalating:
  - `pixi run test-lbm`

## Code And Design Expectations

- Keep changes minimal, targeted, and scientifically motivated.
- Preserve backward compatibility in public APIs unless the user explicitly asks
  for a breaking change.
- Prefer meaningful variable names over abbreviated names.
- Add comments only where the science-to-code mapping is not obvious.
- Avoid broad refactors when a narrow fix is sufficient.
- Prefer package functions and canonical data structures over notebook-local
  duplicate implementations.

## Core Scientific Model Expectations

- Preserve and use the canonical `Network`, `SampleGeometry`, and `Provenance`
  structures.
- Keep units explicit.
- Do not silently change the meaning of boundary labels, flow axes, pressure
  conventions, or geometry scaling.
- When editing image-based workflows, preserve the separation between:
  - segmentation/preprocessing,
  - extraction/reduction,
  - import/normalization,
  - transport solve,
  - verification/validation.
- When comparing with an external reference, do not assume agreement implies
  correctness; explain whether the comparison is:
  - same-network parity,
  - extraction-workflow comparison,
  - direct-image vs reduced-network comparison,
  - or experiment vs simulation.

## Numerical Verification Policy

For changes that affect numerics, geometry, extraction logic, constitutive
models, or solver behavior:

1. run the cheapest scientifically meaningful check first,
2. report what was and was not executed,
3. compare key invariants or benchmark outputs when feasible.

Examples of meaningful checks:

- targeted `pytest` for the edited module,
- a focused benchmark wrapper,
- `pixi run examples-singlephase`,
- a notebook-source smoke run,
- a docs build for documentation-linked scientific claims.

If execution is not possible, state the verification gap explicitly.

## Documentation Policy

- Keep docs aligned with the actual shipped `voids` surface.
- Keep API reference pages API-focused: public objects, signatures, parameters,
  return values, exceptions, units expected by the call, and short usage notes.
  Do not put long derivations, procedure walkthroughs, algorithm explanations,
  validation narratives, or schematics in API pages.
- Put scientific definitions, formulas, calculation steps, algorithms,
  procedures, schematics, and interpretation guidance in Concepts and
  Background pages. API pages should link to those pages when the callable
  surface depends on nontrivial scientific context.
- For numerical, geometric, image-processing, extraction, transport, or
  morphometry features, ensure the public docs as a whole cover the scientific
  definition, inputs and outputs, units, equations or calculation steps,
  algorithm choices, assumptions, limitations, and validation or tests that
  support the behavior.
- When documenting a function that wraps an external scientific library, explain
  what `voids` adds or changes, such as unit conversions, radius-to-diameter
  conversions, boundary assumptions, sign conventions, or data-structure
  normalization in the appropriate Concepts and Background page, with a concise
  link from the API reference. Do not leave the reader to infer these details
  from the external tool alone.
- Do not describe ignored local references or non-distributed external code as
  if they were part of `voids`.
- When adding or changing code, notebooks, examples, datasets, benchmarks, or
  validation workflows based on a scientific reference, add or update the
  corresponding documentation citation in the same change. Prefer the public
  paper, dataset DOI, official documentation, or other citable primary source;
  do not rely on unpublished local files as the only public attribution.
- If a reference informs implementation details but cannot be shipped or quoted
  directly, document the scientific method or public source used, and keep any
  local-only reference material clearly separated from the public repository
  contract.
- When documenting a procedure, workflow, algorithm, or calculation, actively
  consider adding an image, schematic, diagram, or plotted example near the
  corresponding explanation. Prefer visual aids when they clarify phase
  conventions, geometry transformations, averaging operations, boundary
  conditions, or equations. If a visual aid would be misleading, too expensive,
  or out of scope, keep the prose explicit about the reason.
- If you change figures or diagrams, visually inspect them for readability,
  overlap, and scientific consistency.
- If you change docs navigation or generated docs pages, rebuild with
  `pixi run docs-build`.

## Notebook And Example Policy

- Notebooks under `notebooks/` are paired with `py:percent` scripts and should
  stay synchronized.
- Prefer deterministic workflows over hidden manual tweaks.
- Keep user-editable configuration separate from deterministic generation logic.
- If a notebook or script generates figures during automated runs, prefer a
  non-interactive path that will not block on a GUI backend.

## Data And Benchmark Policy

- Benchmarks and validation studies should remain reproducible from tracked
  inputs when possible.
- Raw experimental or scan data that are intentionally local-only should not be
  treated as guaranteed-available inputs on another machine.
- If a workflow depends on optional data or optional software, say so plainly in
  code comments, docs, and final explanations.

## Final Explanations

When reporting work, summarize:

- what changed,
- what was verified,
- what remains an assumption or limitation,
- and any scientifically important caveat the user should know.
